# Policy-Dashboard-KPI-s
Designed and developed end-to-end dashboards across Excel, Power BI, and Tableau using a multi-sheet insurance dataset (Customer Information, Policy Details, Claims, Payment History, Additional Fields).

Key Highlights:

Built a robust data model by joining Customer & Policy data using Customer ID and Policy ID.

Defined and implemented 10 business KPIs, including Total Policies, Premium Growth Rate, Claim Status Distribution, and Policy Expiry Tracking.

Developed interactive dashboards with filters, KPI cards, trend lines, and categorical insights (Age, Gender, Policy Type).

Delivered actionable insights: identified renewal opportunities, tracked financial impact of claims, and monitored payment compliance.

Implemented same analysis in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau showcasing adaptability across tools.

Wrote custom queries and formulas in Excel to validate KPI calculations before BI implementation.
